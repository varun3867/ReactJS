Introduction to Javascript :

	Javascript is the scripting language
	Javascript released by Netscape or vendor is Netscape.
	current version of JS is ES12(ES stands for Ecma Script).
	JS files will be saved with ".js" extension
	Two ways to execute the javascript
		1.Interpeter 
			It is bydefault available in browser engine Ex: Google Chrome, Mozilla, Opera
		2.Node tool
			It is available in NodeJS software
	Vendor provided predefined objects, as a JS developer we can use predefined objects,
	So Javascript called as object based scripting language
	Ex: window, document, console, navigator, date, time, ......
	Javascript code will execute line by line with either interpreter or node tool, so we can say this is synchronous execution
	
	we can include javascript to web pages with <script> tag
	Visual Studio Code IDE(Integrated Development Environment) is suggestable IDE to develop JS Applications
	VSCode IDE is the open source IDE and is provided by Microsoft.
	
	
	console.log("welcome to javascript");               //welcome to javascript
	console.log( 10+10 );                               //20
	console.log( 10+"10" );                             //1010
	
	
	console.log(10+ +"10");   //20   		// automatically string datatype is converted into int datatype by adding one more '+' symbol
	
	
	Except '+' other symbols like -, *, / will convert string datatype to integer datatype on both sides
	console.log( 10 - "10" );   //0
	console.log( "10" * 10 );   //100
	console.log( "10" / 10 );   //1
	console.log( "10" / "10" ); //1
	
	
	console.log( 10 / "A" ); 	//NaN  // A will not be converted into ASCII values. That will be possible in C languges but not in JS
	console.log( 10 / "0" ); 	//Infinity
