								Props from child to Parent
						---------------------------------------------
						
useState			It is a hook that holds the property like array or object or string or null or boolean.			
State 				It is a object that hold the properties belonging to component. 
					When there is a change in the state the component re-renders.
Props 				These are key-value pairs used for componenet communication.
<React.Fragment>    It is used for encapsulating data means wrapping up data into single unit.
<React.StrictMode>  It is used to wrap a set of components and it will verify the components are following some recommended
					practices or not. If not following it will show warnings in the console.
					strict mode checks are run in the dev env only, they do not have any impact on produnction env.
					Like Fragment, strictMode does not render any visible UI element in the DOM. 
					It activates additional checks and warnings from the descendents in development mode.
					
For child to parent communication use event Handling.
we write a function and pass that function name as props value to the child component from parent component.


Parent.js
----------------

import React from "react";
import Child from "./Child";

function Parent(){
    const myFun = (arg1,arg2,arg3)=>{
        console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3);
    };
    return(
        <React.Fragment>
            <Child key1={myFun}></Child>
        </React.Fragment>
    )
}

export default Parent;

-------------------
Child.js
------------------
import React from "react";

function Child(props){
    return(
        <React.Fragment>
            <button onClick={()=>{ props.key1("Hello_1","Hello_2","Hello_3") }}>
                Click Me
            </button>
        </React.Fragment>
    )
}

export default Child;

Destructuring :
------------------------
https://www.tutorialfunda.com/reactjs/destructuring-objects-arrays-reactjs-javascript/
------------------------

The process of taking only part of data from given Object or Array.

Array Destructuring:
		use const arrays
	        const [loading,,error] = ["ram","rajiv","raghu"];

Object Destructuring:
	use const object
	const {loading,products,error} = arg1;

let arg1 = {
                   loading:false,
                   products:[{"p_id":111,"p_name":"p_one","p_cost":10000},
                             {"p_id":222,"p_name":"p_two","p_cost":20000},
                             {"p_id":333,"p_name":"p_three","p_cost":30000},
                             {"p_id":444,"p_name":"p_four","p_cost":40000},
                             {"p_id":555,"p_name":"p_five","p_cost":50000}],
                    error:"Network Error"
               }

const {loading,products,error} = arg1;

To skip any value use :
const {loading,,error} = arg1;

To sepeare one value from an object and to keep rest in the another array use:
const {loading,...rest} = arg1;
If arg1 is an object, rest will be taken into object.
if arg1 is array, rest will be taken into array.
